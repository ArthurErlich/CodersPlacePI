        <h1>Hello there!</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to my little Website Project. I'm Arthur E. or also known as Haylan in some games and GitHub.
            My Website has a Blog where I post random things about me, the world, what I do or even some work.
            I am a full stack programmer, mostly specializing in Shopware. I also do some 3D modeling and
            shading-experiments in Blender.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can see this website as a kind of a resume, or References to stuff I do.
            If you want to know more about me. Just visit the <a href="/frontend/html/about_me.html">about me</a> page.

        <h2>Current Work</h2>
        <h3>Professional Work</h3>
        <p>
            I am working as a trainee to be a full-stack developer at ditegra GmbH in Radolfzell since 2023.
        </p>
        <h3>Stuff I do right now</h3>
        <p>
            There is currently no worth mention project right now.
            I just play with Photogrammetry and other side projects.
        </p>
        <h2>My Personal Projects</h2>
        <p>
            Here is just a subset of my favorite private projects.

            <p>
                This was a little experiment in my studies. I Tried out to create a game with physics inside the
                browser. Fully 3D. I Used Blender for the Models and to create the animation Sprites.
                Loading the game will take some time. But you can have a good look at the code base.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also want to properly mention <a href="https://jirkadelloro.github.io/">Dell'Oro-Friedl</a>.
                He and a lot of students worked on this amazing <a
                    href="https://jirkadelloro.github.io/FUDGE/">FUDGE</a> framework.
                Without Fudge, my test game wouldn't be a reality.
