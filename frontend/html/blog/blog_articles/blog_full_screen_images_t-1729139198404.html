            It is time to show you, how I did the Full-Screen Images on my Site. 
            As some of you noticed, I added a function where you click on an image and it will open up in a full screen window.
            Firstly, I am proud of my self. I did not use any framwork and came up with the idea my self. 
            Yes it would be faster to just use a framework like Boootsrap or an JSLibery for that. But where is the fun and the learning?
        </p>
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <p>
            Yes, my first step was to think what I actualy want. I did some rought drawts on paper. 
            I wont show you my horrible mess of drwaft I did there.
            It is really importent to write down, better to make a moccup of your idea. 
            My idea was simple at first. Than I relaised, what will be my trigger? 
            New Tab or inside the same html document? Where should I put the code?
            As you see, it is one thing to have an ideaa, but a quite diffecult thing is to make it happen.
        </p>
        <h3>??</h2>
            My next stepp was to find out what the bes practis is. 
            There two main ways to create stuff over the top of the page.
            The <code>dialog</code> or <code>modal</code>.

    <footer>
        <custom-footer></custom-footer>
    </footer>
    <custom-img-dialog></custom-img-dialog>
