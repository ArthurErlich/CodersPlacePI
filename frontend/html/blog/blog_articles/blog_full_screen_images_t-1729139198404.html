            It is time to show you, how I did the Full-Screen Images on my Site. 
            As some of you noticed, I added a function where you click on an image and it will open up in a full screen window.
            Firstly, I am proud of myself. I did not use any framework and came up with the idea myself. 
            Yes it would be faster to just use a framework like Bootstrap or a JS library for that. But where is the fun and the learning?
        </p>
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <p>
            Yes, my first step was to think what I actually want. I did some rough drafts on paper. 
            I won't show you my horrible mess of drafts I did there.
            It is really important to write down, better to make a moccup of your idea. 
            My idea was simple at first. Then I realized, what will be my trigger? 
            A new tab or inside the same HTML document? Where should I put the code?
            As you see, it is one thing to have an idea, but a quite difficult thing is to make it happen.
        </p>
        <h3>Reading the documentation</h3>
            <p>
            My next step was to find out what the best practice is. 
            There are two main ways to create stuff over the top of the page.
            The <code>dialog</code> or <code>modal</code>.
            Reading through the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog">MDN developer source</a> or a reference to learn about the modal HTML element.
            I have learned a lot about the standard <code>dialog</code> HTML Element.
            The <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp">How TO - CSS/JS Modal</a> and <a href="https://wiki.selfHTML.org/wiki/Infobox/modale_Dialogfenster">Infobox/modale Dialogfenster</a>
            was a good read to learn how to create a modal without the <code>dialog</code> HTML Element.
        </p>
        <p>
            With all the information gathered and a plan formulated, my part on start implementing the idae started.
