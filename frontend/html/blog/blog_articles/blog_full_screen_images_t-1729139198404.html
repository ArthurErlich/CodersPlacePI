            It is time to show you, how I did the Full-Screen Images on my Site.
            As some of you noticed, I added a function where you click on an image and it will open up in a full screen
            window.
            Firstly, I am proud of myself. I did not use any framework and came up with the idea myself.
            Yes it would be faster to just use a framework like Bootstrap or a JS library for that. But where is the fun
            and the learning?
        </p>
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <p>
            Yes, my first step was to think what I actually want. I did some rough drafts on paper.
            I won't show you my horrible mess of drafts I did there.
            It is really important to write down, better to make a moccup of your idea.
            My idea was simple at first. Then I realized, what will be my trigger?
            A new tab or inside the same HTML document? Where should I put the code?
            As you see, it is one thing to have an idea, but a quite difficult thing is to make it happen.
        </p>
        <h3>Reading the documentation</h3>
        <p>
            My next step was to find out what the best practice is.
            There are two main ways to create stuff over the top of the page.
            The <code>dialog</code> or <code>modal</code>.
            Reading through the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog">MDN developer
                source</a> or a reference to learn about the modal HTML element.
            I have learned a lot about the standard <code>dialog</code> HTML Element.
            The <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp">How TO - CSS/JS Modal</a> and <a
                href="https://wiki.selfHTML.org/wiki/Infobox/modale_Dialogfenster">Infobox/modale Dialogfenster</a>
            was a good read to learn how to create a modal without the <code>dialog</code> HTML Element.
        </p>
        <p>
            With all the information gathered and a plan formulated, my part on start implementing the idae started.
        </p>
        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>
        <pre><code> 
                let imageList = document.getElementsByTagName("img");
                console.log(imageList);
                addFullScreenImageModal();
                function addFullScreenImageModal() {
                    if (imageList.length == 0) {
                        return;
                    }
                    for (let i = 0; i < imageList.length; i++) {
                        imageList.item(i).addEventListener("click", function (event) {
                            let imgEvent = event.target;
                            let img;
                            try {
                                img = imgEvent;
                                console.log(img.src);
                            }
                            catch (error) {
                                return;
                            }
                        });
                    }
                }</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            My first implementation was to try out how the dialog will look. For this I created a simple code which allows my browser to open up the dialog box on every page reload.
            This helps me to change the Look and fell of the dialog box.

        <p>
            Styling was not that easy. It took me quite while... More then two days! The dialog Box was styled quickly. 
            But it had an "stupid" boarder wich was not going away. 
            With a lot of try and error I finally found out tha the border was not a border!
            It was a a <code>outline</code>
