            Yes, I have plants. A lot of them. From a large monstera deliciosa to a set of small jade plants. Today I
            will show you how my repotted snake plant. This snake plant is a present from my grandmother. This plant is
            with me since my first apartment.

                    Here you can see the snake plant in her older nursery pot. I mostly use nursery pots to prevent
                    overwatering the plants. You can see that the Snake Plant started to overgrow its nursery pot. I
                    repotted this snake plant in 06.2024.

                    The new nursery pot was double its size. This is why I was amazed that the snake plant just
                    overgrown its nursery pot this fast! And the rhizomes are very strong. My snake plant first
                    decorative pot was a ceramic pot. This ceramic pot was split in half, and only because the rhizomes
                    from the snake plant wanted to grow bigger than the pot allowed for space.

            In the picture below, you can see how the snake plant starts to create new underground stems, also named
            rhizomes. These new grow is strong enough to push against the pot and brake it.

            Beck to the topic "Why Repotting?" Simply, the plant needs space for the roots. Every plant is a bit
            different what it requires for it roots. But in common, the bigger the plant is, the bigger the root system
            gets. I don't need a deep pot, because of the interesting rhizomes root system the snake plant has.

            Now my snake plant has a cozy place to extends it rhizomes system further. I think I did a good job on
            removing the plant from its nursery pot and putting it to its new home. Below is an image of the new pot. I
            think it looks cool.
