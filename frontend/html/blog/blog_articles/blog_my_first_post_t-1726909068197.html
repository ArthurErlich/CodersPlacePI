        Hey there reader. As you see, this is my very first time posting a Blog.
        Firstly, I have a have severe dyslexia. This wont hinder me on writing this Blogpost. 
        It may discorage some of you, I mean  you, the one who wants to correct me right now! Pleas be human and just point mistaks out. Where? Good question, maybe there is a way to contact me?
