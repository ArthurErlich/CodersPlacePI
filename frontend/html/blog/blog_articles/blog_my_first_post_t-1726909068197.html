            Hey there reader. As you see, this is my very first time posting a Blog.
            Firstly, I have a severe dyslexia. This wont hinder me on writing this Blogpost.
            It may discourage some of you, I mean you, the one who wants to correct me right now!
            Please be humane and just point the mistake out. Where? Good question, maybe there is a way to contact me?
        </p>

                I am Arthur Erlich, also known as Haylan in some Games and on GitHub. My pations is to Ride my Bikes, to
                Code, doing silly stuff in Blender.
                My Trusty Honda CB 500 PC 26 and my old klassic Bike Honda CB 400 (N/T dont konw right now).
                The later on is still in restoration. I tink the bike will be ready for the Year 2025? Lets see how fast
                the progress is.

            Its my way to start going seirus about my future. I do like to Coed, but it is one part to just code or to
            konw what you realy do.
            I alos want to create a Website and I needed a excuse to do so. This when I saw <a
                href="https://shyim.me/">Shyim's</a> blog, aka his online Brain.
            This gave me the idea to create my own Blog.
