    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        I am Arthur Erlich. I love to create and experiments. Some of my hobbies are stargazing with a telescope or just
        the naked eye.
        Photography is one of my more creative hobby I like to do. I also do stuff in 3D with Blender or just some wired
        experiment with coding.
        Sometimes I also build Computer or troubleshoot why they not work. And I do play sometimes video games. As You
        see, I am a nerd and a geek!

        <h4>My time by ditegra GmbH</h4>
        <p>
            <i> <time datetime="2023-09-10">10.09.2023</time> - <time datetime="">now</time></i>
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of a small team, at the beginning we were about 11 employees, working on web projects like
            <a href="https://www.pp-shoes.de/">pp-shoes.de</a>,
            I learned advance skills on using the Shopware Framework as part of my training in ditegra.
            I was deeply involved in the process of moving shops from different shop system or from the old Shopware 5
            system to Shopware 6.
            Some note worth examples are: <a href="https://24sport.ch">24sport.ch</a> as one of my first project I was
            involved. <a href="https://thommel-hausrat.de">thommel-hausrat.de</a> was
            my
            first shop were I did all the basic setup.
        </p>
        <h5>One example Projekt</h5>
        <p>
            The Project <a href="https://www.schuh-vormbrock.de/">Schuh-Vormbrock</a> was a real interesting experience.
            Since a college and I were alone responsible for the Technicals site of the Migration. Where a team of 3
            people. One Project Leader, my college, was the tech specialist and I the tech and content specialist. We
            migrated the shop from a 4Sellers Elements Shop System. I was responsible for creating the script to read a
            CSV file to import the newsletter resident. And update them when the customer inside the newsletter
            unsubscribed or changed the double opt-in to verify. The CSV was exported from a Microsoft Data base, which
            was quite fascinating how other shop system manage Data. My part was also to move the content from the old
            shop system. Almost every time it is a manual job, because we don't want to migrate the HTML Code and to use
            the advantage of the existing CMS System of Shopware 6
        </p>
        <h5>E-Mail sending and recieving</h5>
        <p>
            In my training, I learned how to use and understand the setup on creating a platform to host a website, how
            to manage e-mails in a way that the customer can send newsletter without worrying that they
            land
            in the spam folder of the recipient.
        </p>

        <h3>Game Designer</h3>
        <h4>My time at Black Forest Games</h4>
        <p>
            <i> <time datetime="jjjj-mm-dd">jjjj-mm-dd</time> - <time datetime="jjjj-mm-dd">jjjj-mm-dd</time></i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, I also worked in the Gaming Media Industries. It is quite different compared to an agency work where
            you work on a Project instead of a Product. I will update my CV later on what exact my work was as a Game
            Designer.
