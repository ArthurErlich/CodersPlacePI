    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        I am Arthur Erlich. I love to create and experiments. Some of my hobbies are stargazing with a telescope or just
        the naked eye.
        Photography is one of my more creative hobby I like to do. I also do stuff in 3D with Blender or just some wired
        experiment with coding.
        Sometimes I also build Computer or troubleshoot why they not work. And I do play sometimes video games. As You
        see, I am a nerd and a geek!

        <h3>Full stack developer</h3>
        <p>
            As part of a small team, at the beginning we were about 11 employees, working on web projects like
            pp-shoes.de,
            I learned advance skills on using the Shopware Framework as part of my training in ditegra.
            I was deeply involved in the process of moving shops from different shop system or from the old Shopware 5
            system to Shopware 6.
            Some note worth examples are: 24sport.ch as one of my first project I was involved. thommel-hausrat.de was
            my
            first shop were I did all the basic setup.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my training, I learned how to use and understand the setup on creating a platform to host a website, how
            to manage e-mails in a way that the customer can send newsletter without worrying that they
            land
            in the spam folder of the recipient.
        </p>
