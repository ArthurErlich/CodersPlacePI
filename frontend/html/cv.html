    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        I am Arthur Erlich. I love to create and experiments. Some of my hobbies are stargazing with a telescope or just
        the naked eye.
        Photography is one of my more creative hobby I like to do. I also do stuff in 3D with Blender or just some wired
        experiment with coding.
        Sometimes I also build Computer or troubleshoot why they not work. And I do play sometimes video games. As You
        see, I am a nerd and a geek!

        <h4>My time by ditegra GmbH</h4>
        <p>
            <i> <time datetime="2023-09-10">10.09.2023</time> - <time datetime="">now</time></i>
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of a small team, at the beginning we were about 11 employees, working on web projects like
            <a href="https://www.pp-shoes.de/">pp-shoes.de</a>,
            I learned advance skills on using the Shopware Framework as part of my training in ditegra.
            I was deeply involved in the process of moving shops from different shop system or from the old Shopware 5
            system to Shopware 6.
            Some note worth examples are: <a href="https://24sport.ch">24sport.ch</a> as one of my first project I was
            involved. <a href="https://thommel-hausrat.de">thommel-hausrat.de</a> was
            my
            first shop were I did all the basic setup.
        </p>
        <h5>One example Projekt</h5>
        <p>
            The Project <a href="https://www.schuh-vormbrock.de/">Schuh-Vormbrock</a> was a real interesting experience.
            Since a koluge and I where alone responsilbe for the Techniclas site of the Migration.
            Wehere a team of 3 pepol. One Projekt Leader, my koluge was the tech specialist and I the tech and content
            specilist.
            We migrated the shop from a 4Sellers Elements Shop System.
            I was responsible for creating the script to read an csv file to import the newsletter resipent.
            and update them when the customer inside the newslitter unsubscriped or changed the double opt in to
            verified.
            The CSV was Exportetd from a Microsoft Data base, which was qute interesting how other shop system menege
            Data
            My part was also to move the content from the old shop system.
            Almost every time it is a manual job, because we dont want to migrate the HTML Code and to use the Advantege
            of
            the exsisting CMS System of Shopware 6
        </p>
        <h5>E-Mail sending and recieving</h5>
        <p>
            In my training, I learned how to use and understand the setup on creating a platform to host a website, how
            to manage e-mails in a way that the customer can send newsletter without worrying that they
            land
            in the spam folder of the recipient.
        </p>
